# Project 3 - Predicting Default Risk

## Project Overview

As a loan officer at a young and small bank (been in operations for two years) that needs to come up with an efficient solution to classify new customers on whether they can be approved for a loan or not. Task is to use a series of classification models to figure out the best model and provide a list of creditworthy customers.

## Steps to Complete This Project

1. Data Understanding
   * Outline key components to consider
   * Plan the conceptual design
2. Data standardization
    * Cleanup, format and blend the given data based on the design that determined
3. Build Regression models - Train the data (70% training - 30% validation - Random Seed 1)
   * Logistic Regression
   * Decision Tree
   * Random Forest
   * Boosted Model
4. Compare classification model results
