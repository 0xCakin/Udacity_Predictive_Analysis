# Project 4 - Predicting Default Risk

## Project Overview

As a business analyst for Round Roasters, a coffee restaurant in the United States of America. The executive team conducted a market test with a new menu and needs to figure whether the new menu can drive enough sales to offset the cost of marketing the new menu.
