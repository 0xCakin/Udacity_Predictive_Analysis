# Project 6 - Combining Predictive Techniques

## Project Overview
----
## Task 1: Store Format for Existing Stores
The company currently has 85 grocery stores and is planning to open 10 new stores at the beginning of the year. Currently, all stores use the same store format for selling their products. Up until now, the company has treated all stores similarly, shipping the same amount of product to each store. This is beginning to cause problems as stores are suffering from product surpluses in some product categories and shortages in others. The task is to provide analytical support to make decisions about store formats and inventory planning.

## Task 2: Store Format for New Stores
The grocery store chain has 10 new stores opening up at the beginning of the year. The company wants to determine which store format each of the new stores should have. However, there is no sales data for these new stores yet, the format should be determined using each of the new storeâ€™s demographic data.

## Task 3: Forecasting
Fresh produce has a short life span, and due to increasing costs, the company wants to have an accurate monthly sales forecast.

## Steps to Complete This Project

1. Data understanding
   * Outline key components to consider
   * Plan the conceptual design for the analysis
2. Data standardization and analysis
    * Cleanup, format and blend the given data based on the design that determined
    * Analyze the key components for each task
3. Design classification and time series models
4. Compare the model results
