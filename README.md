[Project 1 - Problem Solving with Advanced Analytics](https://github.com/canerakin111/Udacity_Predictive_Analysis/tree/master/Project1)

Problem: A home-goods manufacturer wants to predict expected profits from
a catalog launch.

Solution: Applied a linear regression model to provided data and prepared a recommendation.

[Project 2 - Data Wrangling](https://github.com/canerakin111/Udacity_Predictive_Analysis/tree/master/Challenge_Phase)

Problem: A pet store chain wants to find the best location for its next store. 

Solution: The option was determined by performing an analysis based on predicted yearly sales.

[Project 3 - Classification Models](https://github.com/canerakin111/Udacity_Predictive_Analysis/tree/master/Project3)	

Problem: A bank needs to know which loan applicants the bank should lend to.

Solution: Built and applied a binary classification since there are two options as "worthy and not worthy". Prepared a report with the findings.

Problem: A chain of coffee shops is considering launching a new menu. They need to know whether they should do it or not.

Solution: Prepared treatment and control stores. Analyzed correlations and average monthly sales. Applied A/B testing.


[Project 5 - Time Series Forecasting, Segmentation and Clustering](https://github.com/canerakin111/Udacity_Predictive_Analysis/tree/master/Project5a)

Example Project: A supply chain requires forecasting monthly sales data in order to help plan out the supply with demand for the company's video games.
